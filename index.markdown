### The Data Set

The data used in this paper is police incidents regarding vehicle thef in San Fransisco in the period from 2003 to 2017 (including 2017 data). There has been 124,759 reported incidents in these 15 years. 


### Time Series Plot

Initial a time series plot is carried out to illustrate the historical behaviour of the vehicle theft. Below a calender plot shows the number of incidents each day for the years. A calender plot gives a detailed picture of the data and how it changes over time providing a deeper insight into the data for the reader. For the vechical theft there is a dramatical drop in reports between 2005 and 2006. One could hope that this was just a sight that from one day to another San fransisco police managed to reduce the number of vehiclal incidents, but unfortunatly it looks like this is not the case and that the reason for the drop in incidents is due to another reason.. When looking into this drastical development it can be explained by a change in how the vechical theft is registered in the database. Before 2006 both xxx were registered under vehicle thef whereas after 2006 it is only yyy. This is a great example of data that can be misleading without the proper data investigation, before conclusions are made.
